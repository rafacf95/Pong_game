# Pong Game (English Version)

A simple implementation of the classic **Pong** game, developed for
learning purposes using Unity and C#.

## About the Project

This project recreates the classic *Pong* experience, allowing the
player to face a simple AI by controlling paddles and a physics-based
ball.\
The main goal was to practice game logic, physics manipulation, and the
overall Unity project structure.

## Repository Structure
